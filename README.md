TODO:
- Create a welcome page that prompts a user to input a codewars username
- If username exists (i.e. codewars data can be fetched with the username)
  - then show a dashboard of their stats
- else
  - append the welcome page with a warning stating that the username does not exist

- For the dashboard:
  - Step 1: Display each coding language the user has for their codewars profile along with the associated kata level
    - Ideas for data to be used for each coding language:
      - Kata level
      - Number of algo's completed
      - Current difficulty level
      - Xp needed to level up (it'd be cool to have this in a blue bar kinda ui similar to video games like pokemon)
  - Step 2: Create a data visual of the languages (maybe a pie chart would be good)
